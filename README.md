## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (Vanilla JS) → API Gateway → Lambda (Python) → Bedrock → S3
                                   ↓
                              CloudWatch Logs
```

### Core AWS Services
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Nova Canvas (image) + Nova Reel (video) generation
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for card/video processing
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API with CORS support

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Node.js 18+ and Python 3.9+
- AWS CDK v2 installed globally

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SnapMagic.git
cd SnapMagic

# Install CDK dependencies
cd infrastructure
npm install

# Install Lambda dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Deploy Backend Infrastructure (API Gateway + Lambda)
```bash
cd infrastructure

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
cdk bootstrap

# Deploy the backend stack
cdk deploy SnapMagicStack
```

**Important**: After deployment, note the API Gateway URL from the CDK output - you'll need this for the frontend.

### 3. Deploy Frontend (AWS Amplify)
```bash
# Update frontend configuration with your API Gateway URL
# Edit frontend/public/js/app.js and replace the API_BASE_URL

# Deploy frontend to Amplify (follow the Amplify console setup)
# Or use the Amplify CLI:
amplify init
amplify add hosting
amplify publish
```

### 4. Test the Application
```bash
# Demo credentials for testing
Username: demo
Password: snapmagic2024

# Try these example prompts:
# "AWS Lambda function powering my re:Invent presentation"
# "Cloud architect designing the future of serverless"
# "DevOps engineer automating everything with CDK"
```

## 🔧 Two-Step Deployment Process

SnapMagic uses a **two-step deployment process**:

1. **Step 1**: Deploy backend infrastructure (API Gateway + Lambda) using CDK
2. **Step 2**: Deploy frontend to AWS Amplify with the API Gateway URL

This separation allows for:
- Independent scaling of frontend and backend
- Easy frontend updates without backend redeployment
- Better cost optimization and performance
