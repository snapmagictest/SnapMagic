## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 📋 Prerequisites (Complete BEFORE Deployment)

#### 1. **System Requirements**
```bash
# Required software versions
- AWS CLI v2+ (configured with admin permissions)
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+
- AWS CDK v2 (install globally: npm install -g aws-cdk)
```

#### 2. **AWS Account Setup**
- ✅ **AWS Account** with administrative permissions
- ✅ **AWS CLI configured** with your credentials (`aws configure`)
- ✅ **Region**: Must use **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) - Nova models only available here

#### 3. **🔑 CRITICAL: Amazon Bedrock Model Access**

**⚠️ MUST COMPLETE FIRST - Deployment will fail without this!**

1. **Open AWS Console** → Navigate to **Amazon Bedrock**
2. **Select Region**: Switch to **us-east-1** (N. Virginia)
3. **Go to Model Access** (left sidebar)
4. **Request Access** to these models:
   - ✅ **Amazon Nova Canvas** (image generation)
   - ✅ **Amazon Nova Reel** (video generation)
5. **Wait for Approval** (5-30 minutes typically)
6. **Verify Status**: Both models show "✅ Access granted"

**🚨 Without model access, the application will not work!**

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/snapmagictest/SnapMagic.git
cd SnapMagic

# Install CDK dependencies
cd infrastructure
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Secrets (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Copy the example secrets file
cp secrets.json.example secrets.json

# Edit secrets.json with your preferred JWT secret
{
  "JWT_SECRET": "your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production"
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
cdk bootstrap --region us-east-1

# Deploy the backend stack
cdk deploy SnapMagicStack --region us-east-1
```

**📝 IMPORTANT**: After deployment completes, you'll see output like this:
```
✅  SnapMagicStack

Outputs:
SnapMagicStack.ApiGatewayUrl = https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
SnapMagicStack.AmplifyAppUrl = https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com
```

**🔗 Copy the ApiGatewayUrl** - you'll need it for the next step!

### Step 4: Configure Frontend with API Gateway URL

```bash
# Navigate to frontend JavaScript file
cd ../frontend/public/js

# Edit app.js and replace the API_BASE_URL
# Find this line:
const API_BASE_URL = 'YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL_HERE';

# Replace with your actual API Gateway URL:
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod';
```

### Step 5: Deploy Frontend to Amplify

The frontend is automatically deployed via AWS Amplify when you push to the repository. The CDK stack creates the Amplify app and connects it to your GitHub repository.

**🌐 Your application will be available at the AmplifyAppUrl from Step 3!**

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

### Demo Credentials
```
Username: demo
Password: snapmagic2024
```

### Test Prompts
Try these AI prompts to generate trading cards:
- `"AWS Lambda function powering my re:Invent presentation"`
- `"Cloud architect designing the future of serverless"`
- `"DevOps engineer automating everything with CDK"`
- `"Solutions architect building the next unicorn startup"`

---

## ✅ Deployment Validation

### Quick Health Check
1. **Backend Health**: Visit your API Gateway URL directly - should return API documentation
2. **Frontend Access**: Open the Amplify URL - should show SnapMagic login page
3. **Authentication**: Login with demo credentials (demo/snapmagic2024)
4. **Card Generation**: Try generating a card with a simple prompt
5. **Video Generation**: Generate a video from your card

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Login successful with demo credentials
- ✅ Card generates within 30 seconds
- ✅ Video generates within 60 seconds
- ✅ Download buttons work for PNG and MP4
- ✅ No console errors in browser developer tools

### If Something's Wrong
1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: AWS Console → CloudWatch → Log Groups → `/aws/lambda/SnapMagic-*`
2. **Verify Bedrock Access**: AWS Console → Bedrock → Model Access
3. **Check API Gateway**: Test endpoints in AWS Console
4. **Frontend Console**: Open browser dev tools for JavaScript errors

---

## 📖 User Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Access the Application**: Open your Amplify URL in any web browser
2. **Login**: Use demo credentials (demo/snapmagic2024) or your event credentials
3. **Generate Your First Card**: Enter a creative prompt and click "Generate Card"
4. **Create a Video**: Once your card is ready, click "Generate Video" to bring it to life
5. **Download & Share**: Save your PNG card and MP4 video to share on social media

### 🎨 Writing Great Prompts

#### Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: "AWS Solutions Architect designing cloud infrastructure" vs "developer"
- **Include Context**: "Lambda function powering my re:Invent demo" vs "Lambda function"
- **Add Personality**: "DevOps engineer who automates everything with CDK and loves coffee"
- **Use Action Words**: "building", "designing", "powering", "creating", "innovating"

#### Example Prompts That Work Great
```
✅ "AWS Lambda function powering my re:Invent presentation on serverless architecture"
✅ "Cloud architect designing the future of multi-cloud infrastructure"
✅ "DevOps engineer automating everything with CDK and Infrastructure as Code"
✅ "Solutions architect building the next unicorn startup on AWS"
✅ "Data engineer processing millions of events with Kinesis and Lambda"
✅ "Security engineer implementing Zero Trust architecture on AWS"
✅ "Machine learning engineer training models with SageMaker and Bedrock"
```

#### Prompts to Avoid
```
❌ "Person" (too generic)
❌ "Developer coding" (lacks context)
❌ "AWS guy" (not professional)
❌ "Someone working" (too vague)
```

### 🎬 Video Generation Tips
- **Wait for Card First**: Ensure your trading card is fully generated before creating video
- **Be Patient**: Video generation takes 30-60 seconds for high quality
- **Mobile Friendly**: Videos work great on all devices and social platforms
- **Share Ready**: MP4 format is perfect for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram

### 📱 Mobile Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Touch Friendly**: Large buttons and easy navigation
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for mobile networks
- **Offline Viewing**: Downloaded cards work without internet

2. **Step 2**: Deploy frontend to AWS Amplify with the API Gateway URL

This separation allows for:
- Independent scaling of frontend and backend
- Easy frontend updates without backend redeployment
- Better cost optimization and performance
