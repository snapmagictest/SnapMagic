# SnapMagic

AI-powered image and video transformation app for AWS events - Quack the Code Challenge 2025

## Introduction

This is SnapMagic, a native AWS application built for AWS events such as summits. The project is part of the "2025 Quack the Code Challenge", an internal contest for building applications using Q CLI. The project, including all files and code, will be implemented by the Q CLI agent through interactive discussion with the user via the Q CLI chat interface.

## Use case

SnapMagic solves the challenge of creating engaging, personalized content at AWS events. Event attendees can capture selfies and transform them into creative AI-generated images and videos using natural language prompts. The application also provides real-time experience rating through gesture recognition, helping event organizers gather immediate feedback about attendee satisfaction.

## Value proposition

SnapMagic provides immediate value to AWS event organizers and attendees by:
- **Enhancing Engagement**: Interactive AI-powered photo/video transformation creates memorable experiences
- **Streamlining Feedback**: Real-time gesture-based rating system eliminates traditional survey friction  
- **Ensuring Security**: Enterprise-grade security with 2FA admin access and encrypted personal data storage
- **Optimizing Costs**: Serverless architecture with easy shutdown/startup capabilities for cost management
- **Scaling Automatically**: Built on AWS native services to handle summit-scale traffic loads

## Development approach

This project follows a step-by-step agile development approach within a git repository. The agent updates and extends this README.md file with additional information about the project as development progresses, and commits changes to this file and the other planning files as they are updated.

Working with the user, the agent implements the project step by step, first by working out the requirements, then the design/architecture including AWS infrastructure components, then the list of tasks needed to: 1) implement the project source code and AWS infrastructure as code, 2) deploy the project to a test AWS environment, 3) run any integration tests against the deployed project.

Once all planning steps are completed and documented, and the user is ready to proceed, the agent begins implementing the tasks one at a time until the project is completed.

## Project layout 

* **planning/requirements.md**: Defines the requirements for this project
* **planning/design.md**: Defines the design and architecture for this project  
* **planning/tasks.md**: Lists the discrete tasks that need to be executed in order to successfully implement the project. Each task has a check box [ ] that is checked off when the task has been successfully completed. A git commit should be performed after any task is successfully completed.

Additional files may be added as needed:
* **planning/test-plan.md**: Unit test, integration, non-functional, performance test plans
* **planning/threat-model.md**: Comprehensive application security threat model and security testing plan
* **planning/a11y.md**: Accessibility goals and accessibility testing plan
