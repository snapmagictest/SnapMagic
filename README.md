## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 📋 Prerequisites (Complete BEFORE Deployment)

#### 1. **System Requirements**
```bash
# Required software versions
- AWS CLI v2+ (configured with admin permissions)
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+
- AWS CDK v2 (install globally: npm install -g aws-cdk)
```

#### 2. **AWS Account Setup**
- ✅ **AWS Account** with administrative permissions
- ✅ **AWS CLI configured** with your credentials (`aws configure`)
- ✅ **Region**: Must use **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) - Nova models only available here

#### 3. **🔑 CRITICAL: Amazon Bedrock Model Access**

**⚠️ MUST COMPLETE FIRST - Deployment will fail without this!**

1. **Open AWS Console** → Navigate to **Amazon Bedrock**
2. **Select Region**: Switch to **us-east-1** (N. Virginia)
3. **Go to Model Access** (left sidebar)
4. **Request Access** to these models:
   - ✅ **Amazon Nova Canvas** (image generation)
   - ✅ **Amazon Nova Reel** (video generation)
5. **Wait for Approval** (5-30 minutes typically)
6. **Verify Status**: Both models show "✅ Access granted"

**🚨 Without model access, the application will not work!**

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Fork and Clone Repository

**🍴 Fork the Repository First:**
1. Go to https://github.com/snapmagictest/SnapMagic
2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top right corner)
3. GitHub will create a copy under your account: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SnapMagic`

**📥 Clone YOUR Forked Repository:**
```bash
# Clone YOUR forked repository (not the original)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SnapMagic.git
cd SnapMagic

# Install CDK dependencies
cd infrastructure
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Secrets (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This step is mandatory for deployment**

```bash
# Copy the example secrets file
cp secrets.json.example secrets.json

# Edit secrets.json with your information
```

**Edit the `secrets.json` file with your details:**

```json
{
  "github": {
    "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SnapMagic",
    "token": "ghp_YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "app": {
    "name": "my-snapmagic-app",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "passwordProtection": {
      "enabled": true,
      "username": "demo",
      "password": "snapmagic2024"
    }
  }
}
```

**🔑 GitHub Token Setup:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scope: **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the token and paste it in `secrets.json`

**📁 Repository URL:**
- **MUST use YOUR forked repository URL** (not the original)
- Format: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SnapMagic`
- This is the repository you forked in Step 1

**🌍 Region Setting:**
- **MUST be `us-east-1`** for Bedrock Nova Canvas and Nova Reel
- Other regions will cause deployment failures

**🔐 Security Note:**
- `secrets.json` is in `.gitignore` - your tokens stay private
- Never commit `secrets.json` to git

**✅ Validation Checklist:**
Before deploying, verify your `secrets.json`:
- [ ] File is named exactly `secrets.json` (not `secrets.json.example`)
- [ ] GitHub repository URL matches your forked repository
- [ ] GitHub token has `repo` permissions
- [ ] Region is set to `us-east-1`
- [ ] App name is unique (no spaces or special characters)
- [ ] Username and password are set for demo access

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
cdk bootstrap --region us-east-1

# Deploy the backend stack
cdk deploy SnapMagicStack --region us-east-1
```

**📝 IMPORTANT**: After deployment completes, you'll see output like this:
```
✅  SnapMagicStack

Outputs:
SnapMagicStack.ApiGatewayUrl = https://abc123def.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
SnapMagicStack.AmplifyAppUrl = https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com
SnapMagicStack.DeploymentStatus = ✅ CDK deployment complete - API Gateway URL automatically configured in frontend
SnapMagicStack.DeploymentVerification = Wait 2-3 minutes for Amplify build to complete, then test the AmplifyAppUrl
```

### Step 4: Wait for Automatic Frontend Deployment

The frontend is automatically deployed via AWS Amplify when the CDK stack completes. **No manual configuration needed!**

**⏱️ Wait 2-3 minutes** for the Amplify build to complete, then your application will be ready at the AmplifyAppUrl.

**🌐 Your application will be available at the AmplifyAppUrl from Step 3!**

## 🎨 Simple Logo System

SnapMagic automatically discovers and uses logos from the `frontend/public/logos/` directory.

### 🚨 **Important: Mandatory AWS Footer Logo**

**The AWS "Powered by AWS" logo is mandatory and always appears in the footer.** This cannot be disabled or configured - it's built into the template system for compliance and branding requirements.

### 📁 **How It Works**

Simply place your logo files in the `frontend/public/logos/` directory and SnapMagic will automatically find and use them:

```
frontend/public/logos/
├── logo.png                 ← Automatically detected
├── company-logo.png         ← Automatically detected  
├── event-logo.png           ← Automatically detected
├── sponsor-logo.png         ← Automatically detected
├── partner-logo.png         ← Automatically detected
└── brand-logo.png           ← Automatically detected
```

### 🎯 **Supported Filenames**

SnapMagic looks for these common logo filenames (in order):

- `logo.png`, `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`
- `company-logo.png`, `company-logo.jpg`, `company-logo.svg`
- `event-logo.png`, `event-logo.jpg`, `event-logo.svg`
- `sponsor-logo.png`, `sponsor-logo.jpg`, `sponsor-logo.svg`
- `partner-logo.png`, `partner-logo.jpg`, `partner-logo.svg`
- `brand-logo.png`, `brand-logo.jpg`, `brand-logo.svg`

### 🖼️ **Logo Requirements**

#### **Supported Formats:**
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG

#### **Recommended Specifications:**
- **Size**: 100x100 to 400x400 pixels
- **File size**: Under 100KB for fast loading
- **Aspect ratio**: Square (1:1) or landscape (2:1) work best
- **Background**: Transparent PNG for best results

### 📍 **Automatic Positioning**

Logos are automatically positioned in these locations (up to 6 logos):

1. **Top-left corner**
2. **Top-right corner**  
3. **Header-left**
4. **Header-right**
5. **Header-center-left**
6. **Header-center-right**

### ✅ **Benefits of This Approach**

- **🚀 Zero Configuration** - No `secrets.json` setup needed
- **🔒 Always Reliable** - No CORS issues, no broken URLs
- **⚡ Fast Loading** - Local files, no network requests
- **🎯 Automatic Sizing** - All logos properly scaled and positioned
- **🛡️ Secure** - No external dependencies or tracking

### 🧪 **Testing Your Logos**

1. **Add logo files** to `frontend/public/logos/` directory
2. **Deploy changes**: `cdk deploy SnapMagicStack`
3. **Generate test card** to verify logos appear correctly
4. **Check browser console** for logo discovery messages

### 💡 **Best Practices**

1. **Use descriptive filenames** (e.g., `company-logo.png` instead of `image1.png`)
2. **Optimize file sizes** (under 100KB each)
3. **Use PNG format** with transparency for best results
4. **Test with different logo combinations** before production
5. **Keep logos professional** and event-appropriate

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

- **Logo not appearing?** Check the filename matches supported patterns
- **Logo too small/large?** All logos are automatically resized to fit
- **Wrong position?** Logos are positioned automatically in discovery order
- **Need more logos?** Maximum 6 logos are supported
