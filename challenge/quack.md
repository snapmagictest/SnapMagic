The Challenge
Your challenge is to use the Amazon Q CLI to design, build, and deploy an AWS application of your choosing, simply by chatting with the Q CLI agent. Through your chat sessions with Q CLI, the agent will write down the specifications (requirements, design/architecture, and implementation plan), build, and deploy your application - all on your behalf!

To get started, pick an idea for something you'd like to build on AWS. It could be a proof of concept for a customer, or a fun project you have been thinking about but haven't had time to build, or an idea for an industry specific reference architecture. What you decide to build is up to you!

During the Quack the Code challenge, you will work with the Q CLI agent to design, build, deploy, and test your AWS native application - all through chat sessions.


Judging Criteria

Submissions will be judged on three criteria:
Creativity
Creativity is all about imagination and ideas. Did we create yet another todo application or are we designing custom schematics for generative AI robots using only toothpicks and magnets? How does this solution approach problems from an unexpected angle or combine technologies in ways that make you think 'I never would have thought of that'? We're looking for submissions that break free from conventional patterns—whether that's through novel user interfaces, unconventional data sources, creative applications of AI models, or entirely new ways of framing familiar problems. The most creative solutions often make judges pause and reconsider what's possible, turning limitations into features and finding opportunity in constraints. A truly creative submission doesn't just solve a problem; it reframes how we think about the problem itself, potentially opening doors to entirely new categories of solutions.	

 What we're looking for:

    Novel approaches to problem-solving
    Unique combinations of technologies or methodologies
    Creative user experiences or interfaces
    Solutions that challenge conventional thinking

Complexity
Complexity is about technical depth and sophistication—but not complexity for complexity's sake. Are we looking at a simple API call wrapped in a basic UI, or did someone architect a multi-modal AI system that processes real-time data streams while maintaining sub-second response times across distributed micro-services? How many moving parts work together seamlessly? We're evaluating the technical challenges the participant tackled and overcame—sophisticated algorithms, intricate system integrations, advanced AI/ML implementations, or elegant solutions to genuinely difficult problems. True complexity isn't about writing the most lines of code or using the most buzzwords; it's about demonstrating mastery over genuinely challenging technical problems. The best complex solutions make difficult things look effortless, hiding sophisticated engineering behind clean, intuitive experiences. We want to see submissions where the technical implementation itself represents a significant achievement, not just the end result.	

 What we're looking for:

    Technical sophistication and depth
    Integration of multiple systems or technologies
    Sophisticated algorithms or data processing
    Architectural complexity and scalability considerations

Usefulness (Capable)
Usefulness is the ultimate reality check—does this solution actually help people accomplish real tasks, or is it just a clever tech demo that looks impressive but serves no practical purpose? Are we looking at something that solves a genuine pain point that users face daily, or did someone build an AI-powered system to automatically sort their sock drawer by thread count? How likely is it that real people would adopt this solution and integrate it into their workflows? We're evaluating whether the submission addresses authentic problems with solutions that are accessible, intuitive, and genuinely valuable to end users. The most useful solutions often tackle unglamorous but important challenges—automating tedious processes, bridging communication gaps, or making complex tasks simple for non-experts. A truly useful submission doesn't just demonstrate what's technically possible; it proves that technology can meaningfully improve how people work, learn, or solve problems in their daily lives. We want to see solutions that users would actually choose to use, not just admire from a distance.	

 What we're looking for:

    Clear value proposition for end users
    Addresses real-world problems effectively
    Potential for adoption and practical application
    User-friendly design and accessibility
    Scalability and broader applicability

All entries should be written completely by Q CLI, we aren't looking for you to show of your own coding skills, but rather how you've used Q CLI to accomplish your solution.

Project Submission
you must have requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md and other fils
