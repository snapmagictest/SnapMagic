## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues via:
- **Email**: [security@snapmagic.dev](mailto:security@snapmagic.dev)
- **Subject**: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"

### What to Include
Please provide as much information as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### Disclosure Policy
- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Please allow reasonable time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **AWS Credentials**: Never commit AWS credentials to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure methods to manage secrets
- **Access Control**: Implement least-privilege access principles
- **Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies and AWS services updated

### For Developers
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper JWT token validation
- **Authorization**: Check permissions for all API endpoints
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### AWS Service Dependencies
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Subject to AWS Acceptable Use Policy
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting and throttling configured
- **Lambda**: Execution role follows least-privilege principle
- **S3**: Bucket policies restrict public access

### Content Security
- **AI-Generated Content**: Users responsible for generated content
- **Content Filtering**: Basic inappropriate content detection implemented
- **Data Privacy**: No personal data stored beyond session duration

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Demo Credentials**: For demonstration purposes only
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived tokens with proper validation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling implemented

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling to prevent abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS and injection attack prevention
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
- **Audit Logging**: Complete request/response logging

### AWS Security Integration
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access for all services
- **VPC**: Network isolation where applicable
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **CloudTrail**: API call logging and monitoring
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection (recommended for production)

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment
- **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar**: Full implementation
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **SOC 2**: AWS infrastructure compliance
- **GDPR**: Data privacy considerations

### Regular Security Practices
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Security Reviews**: Code review process includes security checks

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. **Immediate Response**: Contain the incident
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users
4. **Resolution**: Implement fixes and patches
5. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures

### Contact Information
- **Security Team**: [security@snapmagic.dev](mailto:security@snapmagic.dev)
- **Emergency**: For critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Official security announcements
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes documented in releases
- **Email Notifications**: For critical security updates

### Update Process
- Security patches released as soon as possible
- Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 24-48 hours
- Regular security updates included in minor releases

## Third-Party Dependencies

### Dependency Management
- Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- Security-focused dependency selection

### AWS Service Security
- Rely on AWS security best practices
- Regular review of AWS service configurations
- Implementation of AWS security recommendations
