# SnapMagic Security Guidelines

## üîí Security Principles

### Never Commit Sensitive Data
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit AWS access keys, secret keys, or session tokens
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit passwords, API keys, or personal access tokens
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit private keys, certificates, or credential files
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit environment files with sensitive data

### Use AWS Services for Secrets
- ‚úÖ **USE** AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and tokens
- ‚úÖ **USE** AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration
- ‚úÖ **USE** AWS KMS for encryption keys
- ‚úÖ **USE** IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials

## üõ°Ô∏è Current Security Implementation

### 1. Git Repository Security
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Prevents accidental commit of sensitive files
- **No credentials in code**: All sensitive data stored in AWS services
- **Regular security scans**: Automated checks for exposed secrets

### 2. AWS Secrets Management
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Stores GitHub tokens and API keys
- **KMS Encryption**: All secrets encrypted with customer-managed keys
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation enabled
- **Least Privilege**: IAM policies grant minimal required permissions

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **IAM Roles**: Service-to-service authentication without hardcoded keys
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **VPC Security**: Network isolation where applicable

## üîß How to Handle Secrets

### For GitHub Integration
```bash
# Store GitHub token in Secrets Manager (one-time setup)
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --secret-id snapmagic/dev/github/token \
  --secret-string '{"username":"snapmagictest","token":"ghp_your_token_here"}' \
  --profile snap
```

### For Application Configuration
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use AWS SDK to retrieve secrets
import { SecretsManagerClient, GetSecretValueCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager";

const client = new SecretsManagerClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
const secret = await client.send(new GetSecretValueCommand({
  SecretId: "snapmagic/dev/github/token"
}));
```

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Hardcoded credentials
const githubToken = "ghp_hardcoded_token_here"; // NEVER DO THIS
```

### For Environment Variables
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Reference AWS services
export GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET_ARN="arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:snapmagic/dev/github/token"

# ‚ùå WRONG: Hardcoded values
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_hardcoded_token_here" # NEVER DO THIS
```

## üö® Security Checklist

### Before Every Commit
- [ ] Run `git diff` to review changes
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in staged files
- [ ] Check for accidentally added credential files
- [ ] Verify .env files are in .gitignore

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] IAM roles follow least privilege principle
- [ ] Encryption enabled for all data stores
- [ ] Security groups properly configured

### Regular Security Reviews
- [ ] Rotate access keys and tokens monthly
- [ ] Review IAM permissions quarterly
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Monitor AWS CloudTrail for unusual activity

## üîç Security Monitoring

### AWS CloudTrail
- All API calls logged and monitored
- Alerts for suspicious activity
- Regular review of access patterns

### AWS Config
- Configuration compliance monitoring
- Automatic remediation for security violations
- Regular security assessments

### AWS GuardDuty
- Threat detection and monitoring
- Automated security alerts
- Integration with incident response

## üìû Security Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Exposed
1. **Immediately rotate** the exposed credentials
2. **Revoke access** for the compromised keys
3. **Review logs** for unauthorized usage
4. **Update security measures** to prevent recurrence

### If Security Vulnerability Found
1. **Document** the vulnerability
2. **Assess impact** and risk level
3. **Implement fix** as soon as possible
4. **Test thoroughly** before deployment

## üéØ Security Best Practices

### Development
- Use temporary credentials (STS tokens) when possible
- Implement proper error handling (don't expose sensitive info in logs)
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Code reviews with security focus

### Deployment
- Blue/green deployments for zero-downtime security updates
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent security configuration
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

### Operations
- Monitor all access and changes
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response plan and regular drills
- Security awareness training for team members
