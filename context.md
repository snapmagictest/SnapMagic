# SnapMagic - Project Context & Implementation Tracker

## Project Overview
**SnapMagic** is an AWS-native application designed for AWS Summit events that provides AI-powered image and video transformation capabilities along with real-time experience rating functionality. The system is designed for temporary deployment with automatic shutdown capabilities.

## Core Business Requirements

### Target Users
- **Primary**: AWS Summit attendees seeking engaging, personalized content creation
- **Secondary**: AWS event organizers needing real-time feedback collection
- **Admin**: Event staff managing the application during events

### Value Proposition
- Create memorable, shareable content at AWS events
- Streamline feedback collection through gesture recognition
- Demonstrate AWS AI/ML capabilities in an interactive format
- Provide global accessibility with low latency through AWS CloudFront

## Core Features (3 Main Functions)

### 1. Transform Pictures
- Camera integration for selfie capture using device camera
- Text prompt input field for transformation description
- Speech-to-text option for prompt input using AWS Transcribe
- AI-powered image transformation using Amazon Bedrock Nova Canvas
- Display transformed image with download option
- Focus: Professional blister pack action figures

### 2. Transform Video

- Text prompt input with speech-to-text option
- AI-powered video generation from static image using Amazon Bedrock Nova Reel
- Generate short video reel (15-30 seconds)
- Display generated video with download option

### 3. Rate Experience
- Real-time camera streaming for gesture capture
- Gesture recognition using Amazon Rekognition (thumbs up/down detection)
- Automatic classification and storage of feedback results
- Visual feedback confirmation to user
- Analytics dashboard for event organizers

## Technical Architecture

### AWS Services Stack
- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + Amazon CloudFront
- **Authentication**: Simple shared credentials (no Cognito needed for events)
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda (serverless)
- **API**: Amazon API Gateway (REST)
- **AI/ML**: 
  - Amazon Bedrock (Nova Canvas for images, Nova Reel for videos)
  - Amazon Rekognition (face mesh analysis, gesture detection)
  - Amazon Transcribe (speech-to-text)
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 with KMS encryption and lifecycle policies
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions (if needed)
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch
- **Automation**: AWS EventBridge (auto-shutdown)
- **IaC**: AWS CDK with TypeScript

### Architecture Principles
- **Serverless-first**: Minimize idle costs
- **Event-driven**: Asynchronous processing
- **Well-Architected**: All 6 pillars compliance
- **Temporary deployment**: Easy shutdown/startup for cost management
- **Global accessibility**: US hosting with CloudFront for Africa
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design for event attendees

## Key Constraints & Requirements

### Operational Constraints
- Event duration: 1-3 days typically
- Automatic shutdown after 2 weeks
- Budget: <$2 per user for entire event
- Scale: 1000+ concurrent users
- Performance: <30s image transform, <60s video generation
- Uptime: 99.9% during event hours

### Security Requirements
- **SECURITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE** - All endpoints must be properly authenticated
- **NO OPEN APIs** - Every API Gateway endpoint requires authentication
- **DEFENSE IN DEPTH** - Multiple layers of security protection
- **LEAST PRIVILEGE** - IAM roles with minimal required permissions only
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance considerations
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- **RESILIENCE** - System must be secure and fault-tolerant

### Development Requirements
- Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)
- Git-based workflow
- SDLC agile practices with MVP approach

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASE: Automatic API URL Injection Fix**

#### Phase 3.1: API URL Injection Resolution ✅ COMPLETE
**Problem Solved:** "Failed to Fetch" error caused by hardcoded API URL mismatch

**✅ Root Cause Identified:**
- Frontend had hardcoded API URL in `frontend/public/index.html` at line ~1046
- CDK deployment created new API Gateway with different URL
- Frontend continued using old hardcoded URL → "failed to fetch" errors
- Single point of failure: `window.SNAPMAGIC_CONFIG.API_URL`

**✅ Solution Implemented - Automatic API URL Injection:**

**1. CDK Infrastructure Sets Environment Variable:**
```typescript
// In infrastructure/lib/snapmagic-stack.ts
environmentVariables: [{
  name: "SNAPMAGIC_API_URL",
  value: api.url  // Automatically gets current API Gateway URL
}]
```

**2. Updated amplify.yml with Automatic Replacement:**
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - echo "Replacing API URL with environment variable"
        - echo "SNAPMAGIC_API_URL is $SNAPMAGIC_API_URL"
        - 'sed -i "s|API_URL: \x27https://[^\x27]*\x27,|API_URL: \x27$SNAPMAGIC_API_URL\x27,|g" frontend/public/index.html'
        - echo "API URL replacement completed"
        - grep -A 1 -B 1 "API_URL:" frontend/public/index.html
```

**✅ How the Complete Solution Works:**
1. **CDK Deployment** → Creates API Gateway with new unique URL
2. **CDK Sets Environment Variable** → `SNAPMAGIC_API_URL` = actual API Gateway URL
3. **Amplify Build Process** → Runs sed command during build phase
4. **Automatic URL Replacement** → Updates hardcoded URL with environment variable
5. **Frontend Gets Correct URL** → All API calls work immediately
6. **Zero Manual Intervention** → No more manual sed commands needed

**✅ Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Hex-encoded quotes (`\x27`)** for robust pattern matching
- **Comma inclusion in pattern** for exact line matching
- **Environment variable substitution** during Amplify build process
- **Debug output** shows replacement working in build logs
- **Verification step** confirms URL was updated correctly

**✅ Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **Eliminates "Failed to Fetch" errors** on fresh deployments
- ✅ **No more manual fixes required** - fully automated
- ✅ **Works for all environments** (dev/staging/prod)
- ✅ **Single point of configuration** - one change fixes all API calls
- ✅ **Production-ready deployment process** - reliable and repeatable
- ✅ **Saves 30+ minutes** of troubleshooting per deployment

**✅ Emergency Fix Documentation (bug.md):**
- Complete troubleshooting guide created
- Manual fix commands documented for emergencies
- Root cause analysis captured
- Quick resolution steps defined

**Status:** 🎉 **PRODUCTION-READY AUTOMATED SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED!**
