# SnapMagic - Project Context & Implementation Tracker

## Project Overview
**SnapMagic** is an AWS-native application designed for AWS Summit events that provides AI-powered image and video transformation capabilities along with real-time experience rating functionality. The system is designed for temporary deployment with automatic shutdown capabilities.

## Core Business Requirements

### Target Users
- **Primary**: AWS Summit attendees seeking engaging, personalized content creation
- **Secondary**: AWS event organizers needing real-time feedback collection
- **Admin**: Event staff managing the application during events

### Value Proposition
- Create memorable, shareable content at AWS events
- Streamline feedback collection through gesture recognition
- Demonstrate AWS AI/ML capabilities in an interactive format
- Provide global accessibility with low latency through AWS CloudFront

## Core Features (3 Main Functions)

### 1. Transform Pictures
- Camera integration for selfie capture using device camera
- Text prompt input field for transformation description
- Speech-to-text option for prompt input using AWS Transcribe
- AI-powered image transformation using Amazon Bedrock Nova Canvas
- Display transformed image with download option
- Example: "Transform my picture into me sitting on a beach sipping a cold beverage on a hot summers day"

### 2. Transform Video
- Camera integration for selfie capture (same as pictures)
- Text prompt input with speech-to-text option
- AI-powered video generation from static image using Amazon Bedrock Nova Reel
- Generate short video reel (15-30 seconds)
- Display generated video with download option

### 3. Rate Experience
- Real-time camera streaming for gesture capture
- Gesture recognition using Amazon Rekognition (thumbs up/down detection)
- Automatic classification and storage of feedback results
- Visual feedback confirmation to user
- Analytics dashboard for event organizers

## Technical Architecture

### AWS Services Stack
- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + Amazon CloudFront
- **Authentication**: Simple shared credentials (no Cognito needed for events)
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda (serverless)
- **API**: Amazon API Gateway (REST)
- **AI/ML**: 
  - Amazon Bedrock (Nova Canvas for images, Nova Reel for videos)
  - Amazon Rekognition (gesture detection)
