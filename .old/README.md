# SnapMagic

AI-powered image and video transformation app for AWS events - Quack the Code Challenge 2025

## Introduction

This is SnapMagic, a native AWS application built for AWS events such as summits. The project is part of the "2025 Quack the Code Challenge", an internal contest for building applications using Q CLI. The project, including all files and code, will be implemented by the Q CLI agent through interactive discussion with the user via the Q CLI chat interface.

## Use case

SnapMagic solves the challenge of creating engaging, personalized content at AWS events. Event attendees can capture selfies and transform them into creative AI-generated images and videos using natural language prompts. The application also provides real-time experience rating through gesture recognition, helping event organizers gather immediate feedback about attendee satisfaction.

## Value proposition

SnapMagic provides immediate value to AWS event organizers and attendees by:
- **Enhancing Engagement**: Interactive AI-powered photo/video transformation creates memorable experiences
- **Streamlining Feedback**: Real-time gesture-based rating system eliminates traditional survey friction  
- **Ensuring Security**: Enterprise-grade security with 2FA admin access and encrypted personal data storage
- **Optimizing Costs**: Serverless architecture with easy shutdown/startup capabilities for cost management
- **Scaling Automatically**: Built on AWS native services to handle summit-scale traffic loads
