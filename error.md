# SnapMagic Error Log

## Gallery Loading Error - CORS/502 Bad Gateway

**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Context**: After footer size changes, gallery stopped working  
**Status**: Needs investigation

### Error Details

```

net::ERR_FAILED 502 (Bad Gateway)

❌ Error loading existing cards: TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at SnapMagicApp.loadExistingCards (app.js:4094:36)
    at SnapMagicApp.handleLogin (app.js:804:28)
```

### Error Summary

**Primary Issue**: 502 Bad Gateway from Lambda function crash  
**Secondary Issue**: CORS error due to missing headers when Lambda crashes  
**Affected Function**: `transform-card` endpoint  
**Trigger**: Gallery loading during login (`loadExistingCards`)

### Root Cause Analysis

Based on conversation history, this is **NOT related to footer changes**:

1. **Lambda Memory Exhaustion**: `transform-card` endpoint trying to load 23+ cards simultaneously
2. **Missing Pagination**: Backend may not have pagination optimization deployed
3. **Same Issue Pattern**: Identical to previous 502 errors in conversation summary
4. **Frontend vs Backend**: Footer changes only affect canvas rendering, not API calls

### Technical Details

- **API Endpoint**: `/dev/api/transform-card`
- **Action**: `load_session_cards` 
- **Expected**: Paginated loading (page, limit parameters)
- **Actual**: Attempting to load all cards at once
- **Result**: Lambda timeout/crash → 502 → No CORS headers

### Previous Solutions Attempted

From conversation summary:
- ✅ Lambda function optimization with pagination support
- ✅ Removed base64 image downloads causing memory exhaustion  
- ✅ CDK deployment of optimized Lambda function
- ⚠️ May not be deployed or reverted

### Next Steps

1. **Check Lambda Logs**: CloudWatch logs for actual crash reason
2. **Verify Backend Deployment**: Ensure pagination optimization is deployed
3. **Test API Directly**: Curl test with pagination parameters
4. **Redeploy Backend**: CDK deploy if optimizations missing

### Notes

- Footer changes (420×546 → 525×683) are frontend-only canvas rendering
- Gallery loading is separate backend API functionality
- Error timing coincidental, not causal
- Same 502 pattern seen multiple times in conversation history

**Status**: Documented for future investigation  
**Priority**: High (blocks gallery functionality)  
**Category**: Backend Lambda / API Gateway issue
